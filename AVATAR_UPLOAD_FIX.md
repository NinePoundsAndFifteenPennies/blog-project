# Avatar Upload Bug Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Analysis

The issue was that the avatar upload functionality was mentioned in testing but not actually implemented in the codebase. The user reported:
1. `POST /api/files/upload/avatar` - should upload and return avatar URL
2. `POST /api/users/me/avatar` - should save the URL to the database
3. `GET /api/users/me` - should return user info with avatarUrl

The avatarUrl was always returning null because:
- The User entity didn't have an `avatarUrl` field
- The file upload endpoint didn't exist
- The save avatar endpoint didn't exist
- The getCurrentUser endpoint wasn't returning full user information

## Changes Made

### 1. User Entity Model (User.java)
- Added `avatarUrl` field with `@Column(name = "avatar_url")`
- Added getter and setter methods for avatarUrl

### 2. DTOs
- **AvatarUrlRequest.java** - New DTO for receiving avatar URL in POST request
- **UserResponse.java** - Updated to include all user fields (id, username, email, avatarUrl)

### 3. Mapper
- **UserMapper.java** - Added `toUserResponse()` method to convert User entity to UserResponse DTO

### 4. Service Layer
- **UserService.java** - Added interface methods:
  - `updateUserAvatar(String username, String avatarUrl)`
  - `findByUsername(String username)`
- **UserServiceImpl.java** - Implemented the new methods

### 5. Controllers

#### FileController.java
Implemented the file upload endpoint:
- **POST /api/files/upload/avatar**
- Accepts multipart file upload
- Generates unique filename using UUID
- Saves file to `uploads/avatars/` directory
- Returns JSON with file URL: `{"url": "/uploads/avatars/{filename}"}`

#### UserController.java
Updated with two key changes:
- **GET /api/users/me** - Now returns full UserResponse DTO with avatarUrl
- **POST /api/users/me/avatar** - New endpoint to save avatar URL
  - Accepts JSON: `{"avatarUrl": "url"}`
  - Validates and saves avatar URL to database
  - Returns updated UserResponse

### 6. Configuration

#### WebConfig.java
- Configured static resource handler to serve uploaded files
- Maps `/uploads/**` URLs to `file:uploads/` directory

#### application.properties
Added file upload settings:
```properties
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=10MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=10MB
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Upload Avatar
```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/files/upload/avatar
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body: form-data
- key: file
- type: File
- value: {select an image file}

Expected Response:
{
    "url": "/uploads/avatars/{uuid}.{ext}"
}
```

### Step 2: Save Avatar URL
```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/users/me/avatar
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
    "avatarUrl": "/uploads/avatars/{uuid}.{ext}"
}

Expected Response:
{
    "id": 2,
    "username": "seconduser",
    "email": "seconduser@lost.com",
    "avatarUrl": "/uploads/avatars/{uuid}.{ext}"
}
```

### Step 3: Verify
```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/users/me
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Expected Response:
{
    "id": 2,
    "username": "seconduser",
    "email": "seconduser@lost.com",
    "avatarUrl": "/uploads/avatars/{uuid}.{ext}"
}
```

## Key Fix
The main issue was in the POST /api/users/me/avatar endpoint. The bug was that this endpoint didn't exist at all. Now it:
1. Receives the avatarUrl from the request body
2. Calls `userService.updateUserAvatar()` to save it to the database
3. Returns the updated user information including the avatarUrl

The database will automatically create the `avatar_url` column in the `users` table when the application starts (thanks to `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`).

## Notes
- The `uploads/` directory will be created automatically when first file is uploaded
- Files are stored with UUID names to prevent conflicts
- The static file serving allows accessing uploaded files via browser
- All endpoints require JWT authentication (Bearer token)
